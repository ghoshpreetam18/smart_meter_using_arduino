# The smart meter project is about building a electronic electricity metering device using current and voltage sensors and send the data to cloud for easy accessibility and monitoring. This can also help in monitoring the energy consumption of a household and also to restrict the same in case of unnecessary usage.

#The Smart meter project was undertaken by me and my teammates as a "Minor Project" for engineering curriculum in the 6th semester while we were studying B.Tech in Electronics and Electrical Engineering at KIIT University. 

#Teammates who worked on this project:
#1. Rajdeep Debnath
#2. Shwetabh Sekhar
#3. Siddharth Pandey
#4. Rozalin Panda
